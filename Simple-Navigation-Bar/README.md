# OpenCart Simple navigation bar plugin

### Description

This plugin adds a navigation bar to your OpenCart store. Navigation contains a drop-down list of product categories and some pages (you can select them in the admin panel). Plugin supports a large number of settings for visual customization, so itâ€™s easy to adjust the navigation bar to the color scheme of your site. 

The navigation bar is adaptive and will look good on all devices. In the screenshots below you can see the appearance of the desktop and mobile version of navigation bar.

**Important!** The drop-down list supports only one level of categories.
